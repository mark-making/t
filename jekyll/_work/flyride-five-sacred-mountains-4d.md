## Talesmith and Moonraker are once again working together as SPV Flyride Films to deliver an incredibly ambitious project for a new visitor centre at Hengshan South in China.

Commissioned by Legend Cultural Development we were tasked with creating a pre-show and 5-minute film for the Brogent iRide system at the park, a fully immersive and sensory ‘flying ride’ simulation which takes the viewer on a journey across the legendary five sacred mountains of China.

The ride system suspends the audience, feet dangling, in front of a 4K, 60-foot half-dome screen. Special effects like wind, mist, sound and scent combine with the chair’s sensory motions and our striking visual effects and custom VR technology for a truly immersive experience.

Shot at 8k for much of the aerial photography using our own spherical lenses we also use photogrammetry techniques to capture the terrain so we were able to reference and precisely match details of the landscape including species of trees and flowers native to these areas. The use of drones is particularly helpful in capturing areas unsafe to fly across with the helicopter such as the waterfall. We were able to build incredibly intricate and accurate 3D models from the data which gives a unique level of detail and authenticity to an area otherwise inaccessible to the viewer.

Flyride China's Five Sacred Mountains, due to open soon, will wow visitors with a unique, fully immersive and sensory perspective on environments rich in cultural and natural history.
