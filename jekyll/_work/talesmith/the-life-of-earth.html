        Talesmith explores the history of Earth in spectacular new documentary for Zee Entertainment and Smithsonian Networks Intl.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Talesmith, the high-end factual production company, today announces it has been commissioned by Zee Entertainment and Smithsonian Channel to produce Life of Earth: From Space and Life of Earth: The Age of Humans. This spectacular two-hour feature documentary delves into the planet’s extraordinary 4.5 billion year old history as never seen before, from the unique vantage point of space.
    </p>
    <p>  
      This is a world-first collaboration between Talesmith, Zee Entertainment and the Smithsonian Channel, as Zee Entertainment branch into the blue-chip Specialist Factual genre. Based in Mumbai, India, Zee Entertainment is one of the world’s largest content producers with a presence in over 172 countries and a global reach of over 1 billion people. Harnessing Talesmith’s expertise in producing visually stunning and captivating storytelling, this ambitious film merges the latest scientific discoveries with human relevance, 4k cinematography, and world-class CGI. It explores three main themes; the origins and evolution of Earth, the life it harbours and the ‘Anthropocene’ (the modern age). The incredible journey is full of surprise and wonder - from the moon’s influence imprinted within our DNA, the dust storms that shape weather, and of course the surprising ways humanity has influenced the planet in the last few million years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The past is brought to life through the combination of incredible footage and cutting-edge CGI, ranging from thermal imaging of the first humans crossing the Red Sea to Saudi Arabia, to views from the International Space Station, which have been transformed to show Earth as it would have been seen thousands of years ago during the Ice Age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life of Earth is produced by Ruth Roberts and directed by Luke Wiles. Martin Williams serves as Executive Producer.
