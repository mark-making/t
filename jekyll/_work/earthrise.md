# earthrise explores the most significant environmental threats to the planet and highlights eco-friendly solutions being employed around the world to tackle them.

earthrise is a series commission from Al Jazeera. Each episode (6x30') due to air from May 2019 examines particular threats in different countries around the world and focuses on individuals – often young environmentalists and entrepreneurs – who are devising and using innovative techniques to reduce humanity’s negative impact on the Earth and improve our quality of life.

Stories include how Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar formed a local group to help protect Bangladesh’s last surviving, critically endangered elephants, which had killed some refugees after coming into contact with them near camps constructed in their forest home; and a new restaurant in Finland which aims to minimise its environmental footprint by growing food on-site and recycling almost all of its waste.

earthrise is executive produced by Kirsty Wilson and Martin Williams.

> How we deal with humanity’s impact on the environment is of huge interest to global audiences. earthrise is an eye-opening and informative series which focuses on innovative solutions – often developed by young people from around the world. We’re thrilled that Al Jazeera has entrusted Talesmith to produce one of its highest profile brands.

> The importance of a programme such as earthrise, which seeks to offer environmental hope and inspiration, only increases as the man- made problems threatening our planet worsen and the need to find, and enact, workable solutions intensifies. It’s very exciting to be working on this new series with Talesmith, which has a strong track- record in bringing science and natural history stories alive for an international audience.
