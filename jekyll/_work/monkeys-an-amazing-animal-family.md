# In this series biologist Patrick Aryee takes us on a journey through time, to retrace the primate family’s astonishing rise to power through the twists and turns of its family tree.

Travelling to wild locations in Central and South America, Africa and Asia, he gets eye to eye with some of the planet’s most charismatic and mischievous monkeys.

Patrick reveals amazing stories of how each of the world’s primate species came to be. It’s a 65 million year epic. Through intimate monkey encounters, sumptuous wildlife photography and field demos - we show how different key members of this family evolved bizarre body-types, intelligent behaviours and tight-knit social groups to thrive in some of the planet’s wildest landscapes.
