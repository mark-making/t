---
# The 1 x 60’ min documentary special follows naturalist and life-long T. rex enthusiast Chris Packham as he embarks on an international journey to discover the truth behind planet Earth’s most infamous predator – the Tyrannosaurus rex. Using the latest ground-breaking paleontological discoveries and cutting edge technology combined with comparative studies of modern animals we redefine this iconic dinosaur, debunking centuries of inaccuracy and misrepresentation fuelled by films and gaps in our scientific understanding.

The journey spans the globe. Starting in the badlands of Montana, a T.rex is pulled from the rocks for the first time in 65 million years. In the swamps of Alabama Dr. Gregory Erickson measures the bite of an alligator to unlock the mysteries of the infamous T.rex bite. Using drone technology, prehistoric track ways in Texas are deciphered providing vital clues about the way T.rex moved and how fast. In Ohio CT scanners provide a portal in to the mind of the formidable creature that sheds light on the intelligence, senses and even social side. And in a music studio in Berlin sounds from the natural world are altered, according to the latest research, to give rex a voice.

As the journey for the real T. rex counties the Hollywood myths are finally stripped away to uncover the astonishing truth about an animal we all thought we knew and loved. By utilizing the latest CGI wizardry, the most scientifically accurate T. rex is built from the bones up for viewers to witness in all its glory.
