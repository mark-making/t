_**Takaya: Lone Wolf**_ (1x60â€™) is the remarkable story of a lone wolf living against the odds and its incredibly close bond with one woman, wildlife photographer Cheryl Alexander. The documentary is set on a remote island archipelago off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, which Takaya swam to and has chosen for a home. Despite being a highly social pack animal, Takaya lives a life of quiet isolation hundreds of miles from other wolves, existing entirely on a marine diet. The film is a captivating exploration of the connection and trust that Cheryl has forged with Takaya over five years.
