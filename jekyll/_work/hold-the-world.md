# Talesmith and Dream Reality Interactive have come together in association with Factory 42 in a new world-first interactive virtual reality experience. Users will get ‘hands-on’ access to rare objects, while a three-dimensional hologram of Sir David offers his own unique insight on each specimen in a one-on-one interactive experience.

In Hold the World, Sir David and the Natural History Museum will be brought together using a combination of interactive video game technology and TV documentary. For the first time ever, Sir David will be transformed into a hologram and will guide participants to virtually ‘handle’ ancient fossils and specimens, using his passion for the natural world to bring the objects to life.

The cutting-edge, game-style technology will allow users to hold up, peer inside, tilt and look more closely at the objects, which include fossils, bones and skulls from the museum’s world-famous collection.

Hold the World represents the first time these technologies have been combined in this way. Bringing together the best from TV and computer games will offer people the opportunity to explore one of the world’s top cultural institutions in the company of the world’s leading natural history broadcaster.

> I have enjoyed helping people to discover more about the natural world, and Hold The World offers people a unique opportunity: to examine rare objects, some millions of years old, up close. It represents an extraordinary new step in how people can explore and experience nature, all from the comfort of their own homes and I am delighted to be able to help users uncover some of the treasures the Natural History Museum has to offer in a thrilling new way.
