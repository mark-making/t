## The natural world is brought to life with the creation of The Green Planet Experience, powered by EE 5G, a unique augmented reality experience.

#### Led by a virtual Sir David Attenborough transformed into a 3D hologram, the visitor will take an awe inspiring, immersive journey through the natural world, exploring plant life as never before.

#### Inspired by the BBC Studios Natural History Unit landmark series, The Green Planet, and created by Factory 42, The Green Planet Experience, powered by EE 5G, opens on 11 February 2022 in Piccadilly Circus, London, bringing the natural world, and an ecological message, to the public.

 Cutting edge technology, high end artistic delivery, creative story-telling and scientific expertise bring our green world to life. Handheld mobile devices, powered by EE 5G technology using the innovation of a standalone 5G network, will offer a window onto the secret world of plants, enabling the audience to engage and learn about plant life and biodiversity.  The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, have ensured that all the digital plant life created is a scientifically accurate representation.

 The 5G technology allows large groups of people to access rich interactive experiences. Combined with AR, this means the audience are able to travel together through five digitally enhanced worlds – including tropical jungles, water worlds, desert landscapes and the changing seasons, and explore our planet up close. 

 The Green Planet Experience Consortium members have combined creative content, exciting story-telling, 5G technology, edge computing, science, volumetric capture video technology and innovation to create this inspiring immersive experience. 

 The world leading creative, technology and scientific members of the Consortium are: Factory 42, BBC Studios, 5G mobile network operator EE, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Talesmith and Dimension Studio.

 The ground-breaking experience will be free to the public. The Green Planet Experience, powered by EE 5G was one of nine projects to win DCMS funding as part of the 5G Create competition, exploring how 5G can be used by a wide range of sectors including the creative industries.

Accredited with XXX (insert sustainability credentials).  It is integral to the ecological message of The Green Planet Experience, powered by EE 5G, that all aspects of the Experience have been rigorously measured against the sustainability aims of the Consortium.    

 The Crown Estate is working in partnership with The Green Planet Experience Consortium, providing the landmark Piccadilly Circus location at 55 Regent Street.  The Green Planet Experience, powered by EE 5G is one of a number of recent sustainability focussed pop-ups, which The Crown Estate has supported. 

 The experience will open its doors to the public on 11 February 2022. Tickets are available [www.TheGreenPlanetExperience.co.uk](http://www.TheGreenPlanetExperience.co.uk "http\://www.TheGreenPlanetExperience.co.uk")
