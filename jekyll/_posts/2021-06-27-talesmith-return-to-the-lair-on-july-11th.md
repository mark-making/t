### Talesmith's new film *Return to Lair of the Great White* is part of a stellar 2021 **Shark Week** line up, with the team defying the odds to discover a mysterious new great white nursery ground.

The [Discovery](https://deadline.com/tag/discovery/) Channel and discovery+ showcase returns for its 33rd year starting Sunday, July 11 and continuing through Sunday, July 18. This year has the most hours of programming in *Shark Week* history at 45 hours, taking viewers to new locations to study and record new shark behaviours that have never been seen on camera.[](https://deadline.com/2021/06/shark-week-33rd-year-programming-highlights-1234782046/)

Dr. Craig O’Connell and Marc Payne return to where they unexpectedly filmed a juvenile great white during a past mission. Believing there’s a nursery nearby, they follow the trail to a discovery that could change everything we know about great whites.
