**LAIR OF THE GREAT WHITE,** Talesmith's new film shot on location at a remote Western Australian island, has been announced as one of a block buster line up for this August's 2020 Shark Week on Discovery Channel. We're so proud to make our debut as part of this awesome landmark strand.

**Airs:** Friday, Aug. 14 at 9 p.m. ET/PT

**Official description:** "A team of experts attempts to find out why a population of great whites off the coast of Western Australia is so much more aggressive than others. The team must brave the elements and venture into treacherous underwater caves to find out for themselves.*”*

**Why you should watch, in 20 words or less: “**This episode takes you Down Under to study great white sharks... without using bait!” says marine biologist Dr. Craig O’Connell. “This revolutionary approach not only was successful, but revealed some of the most unique predatory tactics of this incredible shark.”
