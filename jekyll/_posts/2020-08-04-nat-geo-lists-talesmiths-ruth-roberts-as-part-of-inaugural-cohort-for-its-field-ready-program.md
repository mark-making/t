### Disney-owned cable net National Geographic has revealed the inaugural cohort for its Field Ready Program during the network’s Summer Television Critics Association press tour on Monday (Aug. 3), held virtually.

The program looks to promote diversity and inclusion in global television production by providing “a clear path for a new generation of people” interested in working behind the camera.

The Field Ready Program will seek to place mentees on National Geographic productions around the world upon graduation from the program.

In partnership with the National Geographic Society, the non-profit arm of National Geographic, the six-month mentorship program will consist of a series of monthly master classes and digital one-on-one mentorship from leading industry professionals.

The first class of the Field Ready Program is comprised of 10 filmmakers from across the globe who have been paired into mentor-mentee relationships with leading producers, directors and storytellers from across the natural history genre.

Each hour-long master class will include a 30-minute storytelling and teaching session, followed by 30 minutes of Q&A with the mentee cohort.

Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the first year of the Field Ready Program will be delivered exclusively as a digital mentorship.

Mentors in the program’s inaugural year include Wildstar’s [Vanessa Berlowitz](https://xchange.realscreen.com/realxchange/main/profile/public/140577), Talesmith’s [Ruth Roberts](https://xchange.realscreen.com/realxchange/main/profile/public/107825), Nutopia’s Luke Wiles, Wall to Wall Television’s Dominic Weston, The Best Production Company’s [Jeff Garcia](https://xchange.realscreen.com/realxchange/main/profile/public/15772), Icon Films’ [Laura Marshall](https://xchange.realscreen.com/realxchange/main/profile/public/10784), Red Rock Films’ [Brian Armstrong](https://xchange.realscreen.com/realxchange/main/profile/public/35350), Plimsoll Productions’ [Martha Holmes](https://xchange.realscreen.com/realxchange/main/profile/public/72323), Big Wave’s Sarah Cunliffe, and [Brian](https://xchange.realscreen.com/realxchange/main/profile/public/109718) and [Mandy Leith](https://xchange.realscreen.com/realxchange/main/profile/public/39606) of Brian Leith Productions.

“With Nat Geo’s Field Read Program, we finally have the opportunity to meaningfully share our expertise while increasing the cultural diversity behind the camera,” said Red Rock’s Armstrong in a statement. “It’s a win-win situation. Mentees in the program will have direct access to senior wildlife filmmakers who may be able to fast-track them to leadership roles within our industry, and we’ll all benefit from the fresh ideas and cultural perspective they’ll bring to the lenses of our genre.”

“It’s never been more important that the younger generation of filmmakers — our mentees — are helped and given the encouragement to tell their stories from wherever they are in the world, for their future, and their planet,” added Mandy Leith of Brian Leith Productions. “We have hope and confidence in the younger generation of filmmakers, activists, conservationists alike, to understand and care for our world better than our generation has.”

By creating a pipeline of qualified candidates and endorsing them as Field Ready, Nat Geo said in a statement that the goal is not only to make an impact on the industry’s future, but to be “the leaders in ensuring we stand by our commitment to diversity and inclusion.”

Moving forward, National Geographic is focused expanding the Field Ready Program to involve even more diverse voices into additional content fields, including science, adventure and exploration.

“This program is designed to help foster the next generation of world-class natural history storytellers, a genre that has long and notably lacked diverse talent behind the camera,” said [Courteney Monroe](https://xchange.realscreen.com/realxchange/main/profile/public/36083), president of National Geographic Global Television Networks, in a statement.

“As the global leader in natural history programming, we are profoundly aware that there is a lack of diversity and inclusion in natural history filmmaking teams,” added [Janet Han Vissering](https://xchange.realscreen.com/realxchange/main/profile/public/10667), SVP of development and production at Nat Geo WILD, who is spearheading the program. “To stay on the cutting edge in this highly competitive field, cultivating fresh voices and diverse talent is key. We want to make sure that we are leading in this game-changing endeavor, and are now full steam ahead and embracing the extended program, which is already leading to meaningful mentor and mentee partnerships.”
