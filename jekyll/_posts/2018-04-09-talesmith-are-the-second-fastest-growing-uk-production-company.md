MIPTV, Cannes 9 April 2018: Cineflix Rights, the UK’s largest independent TV content distributor, has signed a first
look partnership deal with Talesmith - the UK’s fastest growing factual indie producer.

Cineflix Rights is making a significant investment into Talesmith’s development activities and will help finance their
projects for greenlight in both the UK and international markets. In return, the deal gives Cineflix the exclusive
worldwide distribution rights to Talesmith’s projects.

The deal also includes the option to co-produce content with Cineflix Media’s in-house production teams in North
America, following the success of Rediscovering T.rex, a UK/Canada co-production for the BBC, CBC, France
Télévisions, and Canal D.

Talesmith specialises in high-end natural history, science and factual multi-platform content, designed to appeal to
the modern generation. Talesmith’s team has won multiple awards including Emmys, BAFTAs, RTS, and Griersons,
producing for broadcasters and content platforms including the BBC, Sky, ITV, Smithsonian, Discovery, National
Geographic, CBC, ABC Australia, and France Télévisions. Since its launch, Talesmith has grown turnover by 650 per
cent and currently has a slate of projects in development and production for UK and international broadcasters.

> The Talesmith team are incredibly creative and full of ambitious ideas. They have a great track record of producing high quality, blue-chip specialist factual programming that is in strong demand internationally. I’m thrilled to be working with them to help get their exciting projects greenlit for UK and global networks.
> **Richard Life, VP Acquisitions, Cineflix Media**

> Partnering with Cineflix Rights will help us ramp up development and production of more innovative content for the international market. This is a win-win opportunity and we’re excited to be working with a distributor that shares our creative ambition.
> **Ulla Streib/Martin Williams, COO/CEO, Talesmith**

> This deal is yet another great example of what we can offer as a distributor alongside program acquitions including development financing, presales, and co-production. Broadening and deepening our relationships with producers means we can provide them with the funding and expertise to get their shows greenlit, while at the same time adding outstanding content to the Cineflix Rights catalogue.
> **Chris Bonney, CEO, Rights Cineflix Media**

the development and production partnership with Monty Hall’s Seadog Productions, with Cineflix Rights launching its
