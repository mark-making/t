Chelsea is an experienced Producer and Director specialising in unscripted and factual TV. Her career began in 2014 when she helped to develop a brand-new adventure series for National Geographic titled, *Living Free with Kimi Werner*. The series took her to some of the wildest places on the planet, inspiring a life-long passion for adventure and storytelling. Since then, Chelsea has travelled the world producing compelling content for National Geographic and Discovery Channel including the long-running Nat Geo series, *Monster Fish*. She’s dived with great hammerhead sharks, camped out in the war-torn jungles of Myanmar, swam with thirteen-meter long adult whale sharks in Mexico, tracked wildlife poachers in the Jungles of Thailand and spearfished in the freezing waters of the Arctic Circle. Her passion for the natural world fuels the genuine curiosity and commitment she brings to any project while her calm demeanour allows her to thrive in challenging and unpredictable shooting environments. Her degree in Neuroscience provides a strong foundation for exploring the most complicated questions of humanity and allows her to bring empathy and understanding to the most difficult situations and subjects. Her latest project finds her back at sea in the company of our ocean’s top apex predators for Discovery’s Shark Week.
