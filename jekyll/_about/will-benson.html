Combining his background in Zoology with his passion for filmmaking he's cultivated a broad skillset, from directing multi-unit shoots overseas, running fixed-rig shows in remote jungles, and delivering complex CGI projects for major broadcasters. He's even narratedÂ and written companion books for a number of his projects. And when he's not crawling through caves in the Amazon setting up his next film, he 'unwinds' by running ultramarathons and hiking long distance trails.
