  - firstname: Chelsea
    lastname: Mose
    jobtitle: Producer / Director
    description: Chelsea is an experienced Producer and Director specialising in
      unscripted and factual TV. Her career began in 2014 when she helped to
      develop a brand-new adventure series for National Geographic
      titled, *Living Free with Kimi Werner*. The series took her to some of the
      wildest places on the planet, inspiring a life-long passion for adventure
      and storytelling. Since then, Chelsea has travelled the world producing
      compelling content for National Geographic and Discovery Channel including
      the long-running Nat Geo series, *Monster Fish*. She’s dived with great
      hammerhead sharks, camped out in the war-torn jungles of Myanmar, swam
      with thirteen-meter long adult whale sharks in Mexico, tracked wildlife
      poachers in the Jungles of Thailand and spearfished in the freezing waters
      of the Arctic Circle. Her passion for the natural world fuels the genuine
      curiosity and commitment she brings to any project while her calm
      demeanour allows her to thrive in challenging and unpredictable shooting
      environments. Her degree in Neuroscience provides a strong foundation for
      exploring the most complicated questions of humanity and allows her to
      bring empathy and understanding to the most difficult situations and
      subjects. Her latest project finds her back at sea in the company of our
      ocean’s top apex predators for Discovery’s Shark Week.
